Stunts:
 - **Gadgeteer**:           |   Once per session I may declare that I have an especially
   useful device that lets me eliminate one situation aspect.
 - **Goobledigook**:        |   I can spout bewildering scientific gobbledigook at the drop of a hat.
   I use Science instead of Provoke when my opponent has any interest in science.

.. block:: style=lefty

Background:
 - I grew up in small city in the Midwest of the United States.
   Although I went to a small school, I rapidly impressed my teachers and soon was studying in major universities
   years ahead of my actual age. Now at 22 I am driven by curiosity and a desire to discover and invent new things.
 - **I volunteered because** it's too interesting to ignore - I want to understand the aliens!

.. block:: style=blue

Stunts:
 - **I Can Use That**:      |  For a Fate point, I can use something as if it was an appropriate tool
   for the task, as long as it is vagurly feasible.
 - **So Much Muscle**:      |  When I use Athlectics to overcome a physical obstacle, I add +2 to the roll

.. block:: style=lefty

Background:
 - My strength and phyiscal prowess have always been my main assets, so when I needed money, I joined a crime
   syndicate and worked as muscle. I never killed anyone, but took the fall when one of the other syndicate members
   shot a police officer. Faced with a long jail sentence, I looked around for other options.
 - **I volunteered because** the alternative was a long stretch in prison

 - Average (+1) | **Deceive**      | **Physique**   | **Technical** | **Shooting**

.. block:: style=blue

Stunts:
 - **Pick Someone Else**:      |  Once a scene, you may designate someone else as the target of any attack or
   avoidable danger instead of yourself. You may do this after dice are rolled, in which case they are re-rolled.
 - **Try This Instead**:       |  When you help someone else, you stumble on to a better way to do the task; when
   you create an advantage for someone else, they get a +3 bonus if they tag it rather than the usual +2

.. block:: style=lefty

Background:
 - Life has always gone smoothly for me; opportunities have fallen into my lap and troubles have passed me by.
   I have tried many things in my life and been a success at all of them, but it doesn't annoy the
   people I work with - I make things better for them too!
 - **I volunteered because** life has been so easy for so long that I'm getting bored.

.. block:: style=blue

Stunts:
 - **Latent Telepath**: | For a fate point, I can establish a telepathic communication with someone that
   lasts for a scene. If the target is unwilling, I make a will vs. will attack; if I win I can read their thoughts.
 - **Speciality: Mental Science**:  | I have a +2 to the roll for science when the subject is anything to do with the brain or mind.

.. block:: style=lefty

Background:
 - I was born in a government laboratory, the result of an attept to breed and mutate a psionic-capable human. Although
   I am one of the most successful results, my ability is very sporadic and I know that if the goverment found out how
   well I could do it, I would never be seen again.
 - **I volunteered because** it was my way to escape from the program.

   a soldier or street criminal. My weapons are organization, skill and subtlety, and I will use them to win.
 - **I volunteered because** if I succeed I will be famous and, more importantly, promoted!
