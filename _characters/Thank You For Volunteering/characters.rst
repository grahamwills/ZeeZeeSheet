Stunts:
 - **Gadgeteer**:           |   Once per session I may declare that I have an especially
   useful device that lets me eliminate one situation aspect.
 - **Goobledigook**:        |   I can spout bewildering scientific gobbledigook at the drop of a hat.
   I use Science instead of Provoke when my opponent has any interest in science.

Background:
 - I grew up in small city in the Midwest of the United States.
   Although I went to a small school, I rapidly impressed my teachers and soon was studying in major universities
   years ahead of my actual age. Now at 22 I am driven by curiosity and a desire to discover and invent new things.
 - **I volunteered because** it's too interesting to ignore - I want to understand the aliens!
