Druid Talents
 - **Warrior Druid Initiate**: You are trained to survive the wilds and fight in combat.
   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.

 - **Terrain Caster Initiate**: Access to daily spells that you can only cast in one of the
   eight specific types of terrain

 - **Shifter Initiate**: Enables you to shift your form in two ways: scout form
   transformations into quick-moving animals for out of combat reconnaissance,
   and beast form transformations into combat-ready predators.

Druid Features
 - **Nature Talking**: Everybody knows that druids can talk with plants and animals.
   It may not always work, but druids won't admit it. The DC of speaking to nature
   depends on the information you are requesting and who you are speaking with.

 - **Wilderness Survival**: You never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat,
   or exposure. You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking,
   but only a couple days longer.

Redfield Valley History
 - As the campaign started, you all got to know each other while adventuring in and around Redfield Valley, a bucolic area.  The valley featured two towns: on the west side of the valley was Appleton (where you spent more time), and on the east side was Crownhill.  At the north end of the valley was a fortress, the Vakefort, which guarded the entrance to the Vakevale, a wild area which was said to be full of monsters.
 - You got to know many of the residents of Redfield Valley, and you undertook several missions into the Vakevale, dealing with monsters, and gaining some treasure.
 - As you were returning to Redfield Valley, the floating city of Vantage (one of the Archmage's main cities) came crashing to earth, directly into the valley.
 - After surviving the fall of the city itself, you scrambled to help the valley's residents.  You were able to rescue a number of people in Appleton (though many are badly injured); you went across the valley to Crownhill to help them, as well, but that town was more heavily damaged, and fewer survived there.
 - The ruins of Vantage are now strewn across Redfield Valley, and many of its contents, including once-captive monsters, as well as treasures, lie in the ruins, ripe for exploration.
