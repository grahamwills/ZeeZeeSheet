Talents & Features
 - **Warrior Druid Initiate**: You are trained to survive the wilds and fight in combat.
   Your AC in light armor is 12 instead of 10 like most other druids.

 - **Terrain Caster Initiate**: Access to daily spells that you can only cast in one of the
   eight specific types of terrain

 - **Shifter Initiate**: Enables you to shift your form in two ways: scout form
   transformations into quick-moving animals for out of combat reconnaissance,
   and beast form transformations into combat-ready predators.

 - **Nature Talking**: Everybody knows that druids can talk with plants and animals.
   It may not always work, but druids won't admit it. The DC of speaking to nature
   depends on the information you are requesting and who you are speaking with.

 - **Wilderness Survival**: You never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat,
   or exposure. You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking,
   but only a couple days longer.

Elven Grace -- Wood Elf
 - At the beginning of each of your turns, roll a d6 to see if you get an extra
   standard action. If your roll is equal or lower than the escalation die,
   you get an extra standard action. Every time you gain a standard action,
   increase the die size
