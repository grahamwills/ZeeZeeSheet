Redfield Valley History
 - As the campaign started, you all got to know each other while adventuring in and around Redfield Valley, a bucolic area.  The valley featured two towns: on the west side of the valley was Appleton (where you spent more time), and on the east side was Crownhill.  At the north end of the valley was a fortress, the Vakefort, which guarded the entrance to the Vakevale, a wild area which was said to be full of monsters.
 - You got to know many of the residents of Redfield Valley, and you undertook several missions into the Vakevale, dealing with monsters, and gaining some treasure.
 - As you were returning to Redfield Valley, the floating city of Vantage (one of the Archmage's main cities) came crashing to earth, directly into the valley.
 - After surviving the fall of the city itself, you scrambled to help the valley's residents.  You were able to rescue a number of people in Appleton (though many are badly injured); you went across the valley to Crownhill to help them, as well, but that town was more heavily damaged, and fewer survived there.
 - The ruins of Vantage are now strewn across Redfield Valley, and many of its contents, including once-captive monsters, as well as treasures, lie in the ruins, ripe for exploration.
